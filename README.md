# Ruby on Rails demo App

### Context
I created this app during my web dev bootcamp to try a different language than javascript and test a new framework.
I chose Rails for its maturity and community and the available documentation, as well as the realtively low barrier of entry for Ruby.

### Purpose of the app
The idea is to create a platform where people can create collaborative writing projects and vote for submissions.

### Next steps
- Develop blurb creation
- Add a simple text editor for blurbs
- Add a voting system for blurbs
- Migrate from sqlite3 to PostgreSQL and deploy on Heroku
